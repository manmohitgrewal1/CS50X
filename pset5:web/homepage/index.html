                    You are starting to learn about computation and its purpose. This course covers the same materials as an introductory class for undergraduate computer science majors. Its curriculum, which includes software, hardware and algorithms, resembles that of a one- or two-semester first-year college course or the high school Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science. It does not require a formal computer science background.

There is also a gentler Introduction to Computers for non-majors, and a basic course focusing on programming that is taught in several computer languages.

The rewards of taking this course are immense. In addition to being a subject in itself, computer science can be applied to almost any other discipline from accounting to zoology. The job prospects for computer scientists and computer engineers are excellent.

Be patient in your studies, and don't get too frustrated if you are stuck on one part of a programming assignment or confused about a concept. Struggling with the materials is a normal and essential part of the learning process. You're probably better off going through the course sequentially and consulting external references as needed. Each lesson, particularly in the programming component of the course, builds on previous sections and it is best to keep up with the materials throughout. You're welcome to go at your own pace and begin or end at any time.


Completing the reading and programming assignments for one section can take awhile. If you would like feedback, the instructors are here to help.

                <div class="texter">
                    Computer programmers talk to computers. They learn foreign languages like C++ and Java, and are good at math and data analysis. They design programs and applications for a variety of uses for computers, cell phones and other electronic devices. If you think you have what it takes to be a computer programmer, follow this general guide to starting a career in the field.

Build a foundation in high school Computer programming requires skills that come from a wide array of knowledge. Take courses like algebra, computer science, foreign language and chemistry in high school to get yourself started .
Get a bachelor's degree Some computer programmers can land a job without a degree or formal training, but in most cases, employers require at least a bachelor's degree. Programmers usually have a degree in either computer science, mathematics or information technology. Appropriate college level coursework for programmers includes business communications, database design and network essentials [source: CollegeBoard].
Specialize in one or more computer languages There are too many computer languages out there to know them all. Programmers usually specialize in one or a few languages to work in at a time. Some of the most widely used languages are Java, Visual Basic and C++.
Obtain certification in your specialties A valuable way to prove your mastery of a computer language to potential employers is to get certified. Various product vendors, software firms and professional computing societies offer courses, training and testing for certification in individual languages or programs  .
Stay up to date The world of computers and programming changes at an incredibly rapid pace. It's imperative to keep up with trends and developments in the industry if you want to have a long and prosperous career  .
